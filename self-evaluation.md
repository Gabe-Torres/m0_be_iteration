# Self Evaluation
- How might the `each` method be useful?
The each method can be very useful. For starters, it can change or iterate the elements within my array. 
I can also use the each method to create searches within my array like in challenge 2. Being able to filter certain elements of an array out is an awesome tool to have.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
Something I still need to practice is my use of conditionals. My interation on my array in challenge 2 didn't run properly and it was because my conditionals were flawed. I failed to end my second code block. Going back to my notes and doing more practice should give me a solid foundation!
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach to this
assignment?
My approach for this assignment was to google and research what I couldn't figure out. I wanted to be more productive and productively struggle compared to previous assignments.
